# Configuration

Servers are able to configure nearly every aspect of each tweak. This can all be done in the `config.yml`file. Administrators can also enable or disable different tweaks and recipes through in game by doing `/moretweaks tweaks <enable|disable> <tweak>`and `/moretweaks recipes <enable|disable> <recipe>` or through the `/moretweaks manage` GUI.
